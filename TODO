RESEARCH PLAN

- [x] Reproduce https://arxiv.org/pdf/2507.15855 on some IMO problems
- [x] Explore approach to vulnerability discovery
  Motivation:
    https://arxiv.org/pdf/2507.15225
    https://sean.heelan.io/2025/05/22/how-i-used-o3-to-find-cve-2025-37899-a-remote-zeroday-vulnerability-in-the-linux-kernels-smb-implementation/
  - [ ] Tools
    - [ ] Github access
    - [ ] Web Search (Exa?)
  - [x] Baseline
    - [x] Search for know vulnerabilities on decent size code-base past checkouts
- [ ] Explore approach to other knowledge creation setups
