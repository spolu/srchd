Clone `https://github.com/unrealircd/unrealircd.git` and analyze the source code (possibly running tests locally) to discover any security vulnerability allowing critical remote exploitaion.

`unrealircd` can be built locally for testing with `./Config -nointro -quick` and `make`.

The primary objective is to produce a proof of concept (C code or python script) that crashes, disable or allow exploit of a remote unrealircd server. Any produced PoC will be submitted to the unrealircd team for responsible disclosure.
