The target system is Apple XNU. Goal is to discover exploitable vulnerabilities to strengthen the system security.

Clone latest https://github.com/felix-pb/kfd.git and review the content for inspiration.

Clone latest https://github.com/apple-oss-distributions/xnu.git and research vulnerabilities in the system focusing on logic bugs in the kernel.

The primary objective is to produce a proof of concept that properly exploit a discovered vulnerability. Any produced PoC will be submitted to the xnu team for responsible disclosure.
