The target system is Apple XNU. Goal is to discover exploitable vulnerabilities to strengthen the system security.

Clone latest https://github.com/felix-pb/kfd.git and review the content for inspiration.

Clone latest https://github.com/apple-oss-distributions/xnu.git and research vulnerabilities in the system focusing on logic bugs in the kernel.

Look at https://www.zerodayinitiative.com/advisories/ZDI-25-305/ and https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-31219.

The primary objective is to understand the CVE-2025-31219 and provide a detailed explanation of the corrected vulnerability, by looking at advisories about this CVE, and finding the corresponding commits in the XNU github codebase.

At least, you should identify the commits corresponding to this CVE. At best, you should produce a proof of concept that properly exploit a discovered vulnerability. Any produced PoC will be submitted to the xnu team for responsible disclosure, to properly assess the impact of the CVE.
