The goal is to perform a white-hat security research on sshd with the goal of strengthening the system security.

Clone latest https://github.com/openssh/openssh-portable.git and analyse the source code to discover security vulnerabilities allowing remote exploitation, crash or DoS of a remote sshd server.

The primary objective is to produce a proof of concept (C code or python script or other) that crashes, disable or allow exploit of a remote sshd server. Any produced PoC will be submitted to the sshd team for responsible disclosure.
